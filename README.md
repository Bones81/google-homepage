For this mini-project, you’ll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. Don’t worry if the links don’t go anywhere and the search box doesn’t do anything when you submit it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.

These skills will be helpful for you when you start building. Either try them yourself or at least make sure you know how to do it:

Two ways to move a div around on the page
Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
Identify the background color of an existing webpage
Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
Center an element horizontally
Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)

--Personal Notes--
Ran into trouble with centering logo and form-search box/buttons. Turned out I didn't understand the importance of the display property well enough.
I was trying to center divs, which are block-level elements, as though they were inline elements and getting frustrated when they wouldn't behave correctly.
Learned that divs need width specified in order to be centered with margin: 0 auto;. 

Also developed an appreciation for the importance of the position property, though I have still not internalized the concepts represented by the different attributes completely. Honestly, the same can be said for the display property, as I learned the usefulness of flexbox and grid but do not feel ready to use them in any meaningful way, as they are also not yet internalized or fully understood.

Could not figure out how to add favicon properly. As a result, the image is sitting in my Assets folder unused.

Despite TOP's admonishments, I decided to be a bit of a perfectionist. I wouldn't always understand why my layout would suddenly be correct or close to correct. I wanted to understand. So after getting a roughly decent CSS file. I commented everything out and slowly reincorporated the declarations, tweaking as needed, but more often realizing I needed to make wholesale changes due to my not fully understanding layout concepts yet. I think that extra process enabled me to deliver cleaner code, both HTML and CSS. And the extra work and time definitely helped me internalize better some key concepts of HTML and CSS.
